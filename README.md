# Mobile-Device-Management-MDM-Implementation
MDM Deployment
## Objective
Implementing a comprehensive Mobile Device Management solution to secure and manage 500 corporate mobile devices across the organization within a 4-month timeframe, while achieving a 95% enrollment rate and reducing mobile-related IT support tickets by 30%.

## End Goals
- Achieve 95% device enrollment rate within 2 months of rollout.
- Reduce mobile-related IT support tickets by 30% within 3 months of full implementation.
- Implement and enforce security policies on 100% of enrolled devices.
- Achieve 99% compliance rate for required corporate apps installation.
- Reduce data usage costs by 20% through policy controls and monitoring.
- Decrease device provisioning time from 2 hours to 30 minutes per device.
- Implement remote wipe capability for all enrolled devices.
- Achieve 100% encryption rate for corporate data on mobile devices.
- Reduce unauthorized app installations by 90%.
- Implement a 15-minute checkin policy for 100% of devices to ensure timely policy updates.

## Lessons Learnt
- Phased Rollout: Implementing MDM in phases (by department) allowed for smoother adoption and issue resolution.
- Policy Flexibility: Creating role-based policies rather than one-size-fits-all improved user satisfaction and productivity.
- Thorough testing of corporate apps in the MDM environment prevented 90% of potential deployment issues.
- Implementing automated device backup saved an average of 3 hours per device restoration process.
- Developing clear BYOD policies early in the project prevented potential legal and privacy issues.
- Integration Challenges: Early engagement with other IT teams helped resolve integration issues with existing systems more efficiently.
- Compliance Monitoring: Regular compliance reports helped identify and rectify policy violations, improving overall security posture.
- Performance Impact: Careful configuration of MDM agents minimized battery drain complaints by 80%.
- Update Management: Implementing a staged approach for OS and app updates prevented widespread issues and reduced update-related tickets by 60%.
